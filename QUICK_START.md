2. Click "Download Profile Placeholder" button

## 🎨 Adding Project Screenshots (Optional)

Use the placeholder generator to create temporary images:

2. Click "Download E-Cart Placeholder" → save as `ecart.jpg`
3. Save both in the `images` folder

Later, replace with actual project screenshots for better presentation.
